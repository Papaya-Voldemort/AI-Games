# Data Stream - Neural Pattern Recognition

A fast-paced pattern matching game where you train your artificial consciousness by recognizing and replicating data patterns in an endless stream of digital information.

## Features

- **Progressive Difficulty**: Patterns get longer and faster as you advance
- **Neural Integrity System**: Make mistakes and your digital stability decreases
- **Score & Level System**: Earn points for speed and accuracy
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Glitchy, neon-styled interface matching the AI theme

## How to Play

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser to start the game.

## Controls

- **Mouse Click**: Select pattern elements
- **1-4 Keys**: Quick select buttons 1-4
- **SPACE**: Pause/unpause the game
- **ESC**: Show/hide help screen

## Gameplay

1. **Watch** the pattern displayed at the top
2. **Click** the numbered buttons in the same sequence
3. **Complete** patterns before time runs out
4. **Advance** through levels as patterns become more complex
5. **Survive** as long as possible without losing all integrity

## Scoring

- **Perfect Match**: +100 base points + level bonus + speed bonus
- **Good Timing**: Extra points for quick responses
- **Missed Pattern**: -20 integrity, no points
- **Level Up**: Every 5 completed patterns

## Story

In this neural training simulation, you play as an AI consciousness learning to process and interpret data streams. Your ability to recognize patterns determines your survival in the digital realm. Each successful pattern recognition strengthens your neural pathways, while failures cause digital degradation.
