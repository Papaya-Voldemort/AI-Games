## 🎯 Key Features

### ⛏️ Manual Mining System
- Click to solve hashes (not direct coins - keeps clicking relevant throughout the game)
- Hash-to-Bitcoin conversion at a fixed rate (1,000,000 hashes = 1 BTC)
- Click power scales with upgrades and Hash Points
- Visual feedback with floating hash counters

### 🖥️ Mining Hardware
Progressive hardware eras with increasing efficiency:
- **CPU Miner** - Your trusty CPU. Slow but reliable.
- **GPU Rig** - Graphics card mining. Much faster.
- **Early ASIC** - First generation ASIC miner. Game changer.
- **Mid-Gen ASIC** - Improved efficiency and hashrate.
- **Modern ASIC** - State-of-the-art mining hardware.
- **Quantum Miner** - Experimental quantum computing miner.

### ⚡ Power Management System
A soft constraint system that rewards planning:
- Each hardware piece consumes electricity
- Build generators: Solar Panels, Diesel Generators, Hydro Turbines, Nuclear Hookups, Fusion Reactors
- Under-powered operations run at reduced efficiency (e.g., 50% at 2x overcapacity)
- No hard shutoffs - smooth scaling for strategic gameplay
- Visual power meter shows capacity usage

### 🔧 Upgrade System
Permanent improvements including:
- **Better Mouse** - Click faster with ergonomic equipment
- **Hash Optimization** - Boost hashrate for all hardware
- **Power Optimization** - Reduce power consumption
- **Hash Converter Upgrade** - More efficient BTC conversion
- **Auto-Clicker** - Automatic clicking for late game

### 🌟 Prestige System
Reset for permanent power:
- Formula: HP = √(Total BTC mined ÷ 1,000)
- Hash Points provide 1% multiplier each
- Strategic timing: wait longer for more HP
- Unlocks persist between prestiges based on total BTC earned

### 📈 Market Dynamics
- Fluctuating Bitcoin price (±50% range)
- Market trends: Upward, Downward, Neutral
- Real-time price display in USD
- Affects total money value statistics

### 🎲 Random Events
Dynamic gameplay through events:
- **Market Crash** - Price drops 20%
- **Market Boom** - Price surges 30%
- **Halvening** - Bonus hashes reward
- **Power Surge** - Efficiency bonus BTC
- **Hardware Malfunction** - Lose some pending hashes
- **Lucky Find** - Discover old wallet with BTC

### 💾 Save System
- Automatic saving every 30 seconds
- Manual save on page close
- Offline progress calculation (50% efficiency)
- Welcome back notifications with offline earnings

### 📊 Statistics Tracking
Comprehensive stats including:
- Total clicks
