4. **Photonic Quantum Miner** (Tier 4)
   - Cost: 45 HP
   - Unlocked via: "Photonic Chips" node
   - Stats: 2,500,000 H/s, 8,000W power

5. **Nanoscale Miner** (Tier 4)
   - Cost: 48 HP
   - Unlocked via: "Nanotech Mining" node
   - Stats: 5,000,000 H/s, 6,000W power

6. **Dimensional Rift Miner** (Tier 5)
   - Cost: 75 HP
   - Unlocked via: "Dimensional Mining" node

7. **Reality-Bending Processor** (Tier 5)
   - Cost: 90 HP
   - Unlocked via: "Reality Manipulation" node
   - Stats: 150,000,000 H/s, 25,000W power

### 3. Enhanced Research Tree UI

#### Visual Improvements
- **Larger Modal**: 95% width/height with max-width 1600px
- **Better Backdrop**: 92% black opacity with blur effect
- **Improved Node Design**: 
  - Larger nodes (170x170px)
  - Better shadows and glows
  - Smooth hover scaling (1.15x)
  - Color-coded states (locked, available, purchased)

#### Icon System
Each research node now displays an appropriate icon:
- ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Unlocks
- ‚õèÔ∏è Hashrate Boosts
- ‚ö° Power Efficiency
- üëÜ Click Power
- üîÑ Conversion Bonuses
- üíé Special Effects
- ‚úì Purchased
- üîí Locked

#### Legend System
Added a visual legend at the top of the research tree showing what each icon represents.

#### Connection Lines
- Clearer connection visualization
- Purchased connections glow orange
- Drop shadows on active connections

### 4. Enhanced Prestige Panel UI

#### Layout Improvements
- **Better Container**: Max-width 800px with gradient background
- **Grid Stats**: Responsive grid layout for prestige stats
- **Hover Effects**: Stats cards lift up on hover with shadow
- **Better Spacing**: More breathing room between elements

#### Button Improvements
- **Larger Prestige Button**: 22px padding, 1.6rem font
- **Better Animations**: Smooth lift on hover with enhanced shadows
- **Active State**: Slight press effect when clicking
- **Danger Button Styling**: Reset button has distinct red gradient

#### Typography
- Larger, bolder text for important values
- Better contrast with Orbitron font
- Letter spacing for better readability

### 5. Research Detail Modal Improvements
- **Effects Display**: New section showing all bonuses the node provides
- **Hardware Preview**: Shows which hardware will be unlocked
- **Better Formatting**: Clearer cost, tier, and requirement display
- **Slide-In Animation**: Smooth entrance animation
- **Improved Buttons**: Larger, more prominent action buttons

### 6. Mobile Responsive Design
Added comprehensive mobile breakpoints (< 768px):
- Stacked prestige stats (1 column)
- Smaller research nodes (140x140px)
- Adjusted header layout
- Smaller legend items
- Full-width buttons in modals
- Reduced padding throughout

### 7. Code Improvements

#### New Functions
- Hardware unlock handling in `purchaseResearch()`
- Research requirement checking in `meetsRequirement()`
- Icon selection logic in `buildResearchTree()`
- Effects text generation in `showResearchDetails()`

#### Better State Management
- Research unlocks now properly trigger hardware availability
- CheckUnlocks() properly handles research-based requirements
- Hardware shop rebuilds when research unlocks new items

## Technical Details

### Hardware Requirements
New hardware types use a `requirement: { researchNode: 'node_id' }` system instead of BTC/HP requirements, ensuring they can only be unlocked through the research tree.

### Effect System
Research nodes can now have an `unlockHardware` effect that specifies which hardware ID to unlock when purchased.

### Visual Hierarchy
- Tier 1 nodes at x: 10%
- Tier 2 nodes at x: 28%
- Tier 3 nodes at x: 46%
- Tier 4 nodes at x: 64%
- Tier 5 nodes at x: 82%

This creates a clear left-to-right progression through the tech tree.

## User Experience Improvements
1. **No Overlapping**: All nodes have sufficient spacing
2. **Clear Progression**: Visual flow from left to right
3. **Better Feedback**: Icons immediately show node purpose
4. **Detailed Information**: Modal shows exact effects and requirements
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Fully responsive design
6. **Professional Polish**: Consistent animations and transitions

## Future Expansion
The system is now easily extensible:
- Add more hardware tiers by creating new research nodes
- Add new effect types (e.g., `automationBonus`, `prestigeBonuses`)
- Create branching paths in the tech tree
- Add research prerequisites for upgrades/generators
