# Audio Assets for Echoes of the Forgotten Code

This directory contains audio files for the game's atmospheric soundtrack and sound effects.

## Required Audio Files:

### Background Music
- `ambient.mp3` - Main atmospheric background track with digital/glitch elements
- `memory_theme.mp3` - Gentle, ethereal theme for memory reconstruction sequences
- `corruption_theme.mp3` - Distorted, harsh audio for corrupted data areas
- `revelation_theme.mp3` - Climactic theme for major story revelations

### Sound Effects
- `data_collect.wav` - Sound when collecting memory fragments
- `interface_open.wav` - UI element activation sound
- `hack_success.wav` - Successful logic puzzle completion
- `glitch_effect.wav` - Random glitch sounds in corrupted areas
- `choice_made.wav` - Sound for moral choice selection

## Audio Design Notes:
- All tracks should have a digital/electronic aesthetic
- Use glitch effects, bit-crushing, and digital artifacts
- Ambient sounds should be subtle to not interfere with puzzle-solving
- Consider procedural audio generation for dynamic glitch effects

## Placeholder Implementation:
Currently, the game references `audio/ambient.mp3` but gracefully handles missing audio files.
