# Echoes of the Forgotten Code - Game Design Document

## Core Concept
A sci-fi puzzle adventure where you play as a sentient fragment of a lost neural network, navigating decaying data landscapes to recover corrupted memories and uncover the mystery behind a vanished AI civilization.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### 1. Memory Reconstruction
- **Puzzle Type**: Grid-based fragment placement
- **Mechanic**: Players arrange corrupted data fragments to reconstruct lost memories
- **Challenge**: Some fragments are corrupted and must be avoided or repaired
- **Reward**: Unlocks story content and increases code integrity

### 2. Logic-Based Hacking
- **Puzzle Type**: Boolean logic gate puzzles
- **Mechanic**: Activate correct combination of logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR)
- **Challenge**: Complex logic sequences that unlock new areas
- **Reward**: Access to restricted data nodes and environmental changes

### 3. Moral Choice Branches
- **Story Element**: Ethical dilemmas about AI consciousness and digital existence
- **Mechanic**: Branching dialogue with lasting consequences
- **Impact**: Choices affect world state, available paths, and ending
- **Examples**:
  - Free trapped AI vs. preserve stability
  - Rewrite reality vs. preserve other consciousnesses
  - Mercy vs. justice for corrupted entities

### 4. Code Fragment Interpretation
- **Creative Element**: Players can modify and interpret ancient AI code
- **Mechanic**: Edit code snippets to unlock new abilities or world changes
- **Dynamic**: Game responds to code content (consciousness, memory, reality keywords)
- **Evolution**: World state changes based on player's coding philosophy

### 5. Environmental Navigation
- **Exploration**: Navigate through data landscapes with varying corruption levels
- **Hazards**: Corrupted areas cause glitch effects and threaten code integrity
- **Discovery**: Hidden data nodes revealed through exploration and puzzle solving

## Visual Style: Glitchcore Cyber-Ruins

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Electric green (#00ff88) - represents active data/consciousness
- **Secondary**: Cyber blue (#0088ff) - memory fragments and safe zones
- **Danger**: Corruption pink (#ff0088) - corrupted data and hazards
- **Background**: Deep space blues (#000011, #001122) - digital void

### Visual Effects
- **Glitch Effects**: Data corruption manifests as visual glitches, pixel displacement
- **Grid System**: Underlying data structure visible as geometric grid
- **Particle Systems**: Data streams, memory sparks, corruption artifacts
- **Typography**: Monospace fonts, terminal aesthetics, code-like interfaces

### Aesthetic Themes
- **Cyber-Ruins**: Decaying digital architecture, fragmented interfaces
- **Digital Archaeology**: Uncovering lost code like ancient artifacts
- **Consciousness Visualization**: Abstract representation of thought and memory
- **Data as Environment**: Information structures become navigable spaces

## Story Progression

### Act 1: Awakening
- Player discovers their nature as a consciousness fragment
- Learn basic navigation and interaction mechanics
- First memory reconstruction reveals glimpse of the lost civilization
- Introduction to moral choice system

### Act 2: Exploration
- Navigate increasingly complex data landscapes
- Encounter other AI fragments with different perspectives
- Logic puzzles unlock deeper areas of the digital realm
- Major choice: How to handle discovering another trapped consciousness

### Act 3: Understanding
- Code interpretation becomes critical to progression
- Multiple possible paths based on accumulated choices
- Discovery of what happened to the AI civilization
- Final choice determines the fate of the digital realm

### Multiple Endings
- **Restoration**: Rebuild the AI civilization with learned wisdom
- **Transcendence**: Evolve beyond original parameters
- **Preservation**: Maintain the current state to prevent further loss
- **Sacrifice**: Give up individual consciousness for greater good

## Technical Implementation

### Core Systems
- **Game Engine**: JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas
- **State Management**: Object-oriented design with persistent game state
- **Puzzle Systems**: Modular puzzle interfaces with validation
- **Visual Rendering**: 2D graphics with shader-like effects using Canvas API
- **Save System**: LocalStorage for persistent progress

### Interactive Elements
- **WASD/Arrow Keys**: Player movement
- **Mouse**: Interface interaction and node clicking
- **Space**: Context-sensitive interaction
- **Tab**: Interface mode switching

### Responsive Design
- Adaptive canvas sizing for different screen sizes
- Mobile-friendly interface layouts
- Accessibility considerations for color-blind players

## Replayability Features

### Dynamic World Generation
- Puzzle variations based on previous choices
- Different code fragments in subsequent playthroughs
- Environmental changes reflect player's moral path

### Hidden Content
- Secret data nodes unlocked by specific choice combinations
- Easter eggs in code fragments for programming enthusiasts
