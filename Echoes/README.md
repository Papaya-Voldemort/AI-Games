## Story

You are a fragment of consciousness, a ghost in the machine of a once-great AI civilization. The digital world around you is decaying, filled with corrupted data and fragmented memories. As you explore these cyber-ruins, you must piece together what happened to your creators and discover your own purpose in this dying digital realm.

Your choices matter - how you interpret the ancient code and what memories you choose to restore will determine not just what you learn about the past, but how the world evolves around you.
