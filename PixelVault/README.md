## üéÆ Game Overview

PixelVault is a precision platformer that combines classic 2D platforming with modern movement mechanics. Navigate through digital environments filled with corrupted data, energy barriers, and moving platforms while collecting data fragments to unlock each vault's exit.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Advanced Movement System
- **Double Jump** - Execute a second jump in mid-air for extended reach
- **Wall Jumping** - Slide down walls and jump off them to reach new heights  
- **Wall Sliding** - Slow your fall by holding against walls
- **Dash Ability** - Quick horizontal movement with limited uses per level
- **Precise Physics** - Responsive controls with momentum and friction

### Progressive Level Design
- **12 Challenging Levels** - Each introducing new mechanics and increasing difficulty
- **Tutorial Integration** - Learn mechanics naturally through level progression
- **Multiple Solutions** - Often several ways to complete each challenge
- **Skill Mastery** - Later levels require combining all movement abilities

### Unique Gameplay Elements
- **Corrupted Platforms** - Blocks that phase in and out of existence
- **Moving Platforms** - Navigate timing-based challenges
- **Energy Hazards** - Deadly barriers that reset the level on contact
- **Data Fragments** - Collectibles required to unlock the vault exit
- **Limited Resources** - Dash ability resets only when landing on solid ground

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Click "ENTER THE VAULT" to begin your digital infiltration
3. Use keyboard controls to navigate through the levels
4. Collect all üíé data fragments in each vault
5. Master the movement mechanics to reach higher vaults

## üé™ Level Design Philosophy

Each vault in PixelVault is carefully designed to:

- **Teach Through Play** - New mechanics introduced naturally
- **Build Complexity** - Combine previous skills with new challenges
- **Reward Mastery** - Later levels require precise execution
- **Encourage Experimentation** - Multiple paths and approaches
- **Maintain Flow** - Challenging but fair difficulty progression

The game respects the player's time while providing a substantial challenge for those seeking to master all 12 vaults.
