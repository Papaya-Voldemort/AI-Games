# HadleeKart Game Design Document

## üéØ Game Vision

HadleeKart is a complete top-down 2D racing game that captures the excitement of classic kart racing games like Mario Kart, featuring competitive AI opponents, strategic power-ups, and smooth racing mechanics in a browser-based experience.

## üéÆ Core Gameplay

### Racing Mechanics
- **Vehicle Physics**: Realistic acceleration, braking, and turning with speed-dependent handling

- **Track Navigation**: Oval circuit with varying difficulty sections and strategic racing lines
- **Lap Racing**: 3-lap races with checkpoint-based lap detection system

### Victory Conditions
- Complete 3 laps before AI opponents
- Final position ranking (1st through 8th place)
- Best lap time tracking for personal records

## ü§ñ AI System Design

### AI Personalities
Each of the 7 AI opponents has unique characteristics:

1. **Aggressive (Red Zone Racer)**
   - High aggression (0.8), excellent skill (0.9), moderate risk-taking (0.7)
   - Tends to take racing lines aggressively and push other karts

2. **Cautious (Safety First)**
   - Low aggression (0.3), good skill (0.8), low risk-taking (0.4)
   - Focuses on consistent lap times and avoiding collisions

3. **Skilled (The Pro)**
   - Moderate aggression (0.6), exceptional skill (0.95), balanced risk-taking (0.5)
   - Takes optimal racing lines and makes calculated moves

4. **Risky (Gambler)**
   - High aggression (0.7), moderate skill (0.6), high risk-taking (0.8)
   - Takes chances with risky overtakes and power-up usage

5. **Defensive (The Blocker)**
   - Low aggression (0.4), good skill (0.7), low risk-taking (0.3)
   - Focuses on maintaining position and blocking opponents

6. **Reckless (Wild Card)**
   - Maximum aggression (0.9), good skill (0.7), maximum risk-taking (0.9)
   - Unpredictable behavior with aggressive moves

7. **Balanced (All-Rounder)**
   - Moderate aggression (0.5), high skill (0.85), moderate risk-taking (0.6)
   - Well-rounded performance across all racing aspects

### AI Behavior Systems
- **Pathfinding**: Target-based navigation using track checkpoints
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Lookahead collision detection with 80-pixel range
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Personality-based decision making
- **Power-Up Usage**: Strategic item usage with 2% chance per frame when holding items

## üéÅ Power-Up System

### Power-Up Types and Mechanics

#### üçÑ Speed Boost Mushroom (40% spawn rate)
- **Effect**: 1.5x speed multiplier for 2 seconds
- **Strategy**: Best used on straightaways for maximum advantage
- **Visual**: Floating orange mushroom icon with animation

#### üçå Banana Peel (30% spawn rate)
- **Effect**: Deployed behind kart, causes opponents to skid and slow significantly
- **Strategy**: Use defensively or on tight corners
- **Lifetime**: 10 seconds before automatic cleanup
- **Visual**: Yellow banana with realistic collision detection

#### üî¥ Red Homing Shell (20% spawn rate)
- **Effect**: Targets nearest opponent with 6-speed homing projectile
- **Range**: 8-second lifetime with intelligent target tracking
- **Impact**: Reduces target speed to 30% temporarily
- **Visual**: Red shell with particle trail and homing behavior

#### ‚ö° Lightning Strike (10% spawn rate - Rare)
- **Effect**: Affects ALL opponents except the caster
- **Visual**: Full-screen white flash effect with 0.3-second duration
- **Impact**: Reduces all opponent speeds to 30% for 3 seconds
- **Strategic**: Most powerful but requires timing

### Power-Up Distribution
- 15 power-ups spawn initially around the track
- Automatic respawn 5-10 seconds after collection
- Random placement with track-based positioning
- Only one power-up can be held at a time

## üèÅ Track Design

### Layout Specifications
- **Dimensions**: 2000x1400 pixel racing surface
- **Track Width**: 120 pixels with lane markings
- **Surface**: Multi-layered visual design with proper racing lines

### Track Features

- **Visual Elements**: 
  - Lane markings with dashed white lines
  - Colored checkpoint circles for navigation
  - Start/finish line with distinctive white marking

### Checkpoint System
- 8 strategically placed checkpoints around the track
- 80-pixel radius detection zones
- Sequential progression required for lap completion
- Visual indicators with color coding (red for start/finish, orange for others)

## üé® Visual Design Philosophy

### Art Style
- **Clean Vector Aesthetic**: Simple, readable shapes for fast gameplay
- **High Contrast**: Clear distinction between track, karts, and power-ups
- **Color Psychology**: Each kart color chosen for maximum visibility and distinction
